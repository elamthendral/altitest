Order Placement:

Shippers place orders through the Order Management Service.
Order details include origin, destination, freight type, etc.
The Order Management Service stores the order in the database.

Mode of Transport Determination:

The Carrier Service receives the order details.
Based on factors such as distance, type of freight, and availability, the Carrier Service determines the appropriate mode of transport (On Road, Rail, Air, Ocean).

Carrier Assignment:

Once the mode of transport is determined, the Carrier Service assigns a carrier for the order.
Carrier selection may depend on factors like carrier availability, capacity, and specialization in the chosen mode of transport.

Position Tracking:

The Carrier Service starts tracking the position of the assigned carrier.
Position updates (longitude and latitude) are received from the carrier every 10 minutes.
Position updates are stored in the Position Tracking Service.

Exception Handling:

The Position Tracking Service monitors position updates for exceptions.
Flag exceptions such as Carrier Delay, Dwell, and Unaccounted positions based on predefined criteria.
Notify stakeholders (e.g., Shippers, Carriers) via email or other communication channels in case of exceptions.

Order Completion:

Once the carrier reaches the destination, the Order Management Service marks the order as completed.
Finalize the order details and update the status in the database.

Security and Authentication:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to microservices.
Authenticate users (Shippers, Carriers) before allowing access to protected endpoints.
Ensure data confidentiality and integrity using encryption and secure communication protocols.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the performance and health of microservices.
Monitor system metrics, logs, and exceptions using tools like AWS CloudWatch, ELK stack, etc.

Scalability and Deployment:

Deploy microservices using containerization (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).
Use auto-scaling features provided by cloud providers to scale microservices based on demand.

Database Management:

Use a suitable database technology (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store order details, carrier information, and position updates.
Ensure data consistency, availability, and durability by configuring appropriate database configurations and replication strategies.
